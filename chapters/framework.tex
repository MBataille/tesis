\section{Dynamical Systems}

[introducir bien el tema]. 

The general form for a dynamical system will be the following.

\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{d\bm{u}}{dt} = \bm{f}(\bm{u}, \eta), \qquad \bm{f} : \mathbb{R}^N \times \mathbb{R}^{n_\eta} \to \mathbb{R}^N
    \label{eq:def_ds}
\end{equation}

Here, $\bm{u}$ represents the state vector of the system, it might correspond to the
concentrations of different chemicals, the population of certain species or the amplitude
of an electric field. The temporal evolution of the state of the system is thus determined by 
the vector function $\bm{f}$. This function may in turn depend on one or several control
parameters $\eta$ relevant to the modeled experiment such as
[Agregar parametros]

In this thesis, we will consider different dynamical systems represented by Eq.~(\ref{eq:def_ds}) where the function
$\bm{f}$ will be {\em nonlinear}. Although one might argue that, at a fundamental level, the physical laws
that describe the evolution of a system (Schrödinger equation for example) are linear, when one looks at meso- or macroscopical
systems, nonlinear terms naturally arise due to the coarse-graining of the microscopical degrees of freedom [ref Karadr].


In the case of a nonlinear dynamical system, it becomes extremely difficult, and often impossible, to find
general explicit solutions of Eq.~(\ref{eq:def_ds}). But it turns out that in most cases an in depth
description of the model can be provided by studying only the steady states ($\bm{f}(\bm{u}, \eta) = 0$) and their qualitative changes as parameters 
are varied. In other words, the problem can be reduced as to find the {\em equilibria} and {\em bifurcations} of the system.
In the following section, we shall describe the simplest bifurcations a system can experience.

\section{Bifurcations}

\subsection{Saddle-Node bifurcation}

{\em Saddle-node} or {\em fold} bifurcations provide the simplest mechanism 
for which a pair of stable and unstable equilibria can be created (or destroyed) 
as the control parameter is changed. Although they arise in a huge variety of systems 
[insert ref], close to the bifurcation point the dynamics can always be reduced to
the following minimal or {\em normal form}.

\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{du}{dt} = \eta - u^2
    \label{eq:pre_bif_sn}
\end{equation}

Following the notation of Eq.~(\ref{eq:def_ds}), u represents the state variable
and $\eta$ the control parameter. For $\eta > 0$, the system presents two equilibria $u_{\pm} = \pm\sqrt{\eta}$, where $u_+$ is
stable and $u_-$ unstable. An interesting case occurs when $\eta = 0$, at which point $u = 0$ is
half-stable (stable for positive perturbations and unstable for negative perturbations). Lastly,
for $\eta < 0$ there are no equilibria. Figure~(\ref{fig:pre_bifs_sn}) provides a visual representation
of the previous analysis.

In short, as the bifurcation parameter $\eta$ is decreased (increased)
starting from positive (negative) values, the two equilibria attract (repel) each other and suddenly annihilate (appear).

    For centuries, the mystery of synchronization between fireflies has
    captivated many people. Although many open questions remain on this topic [ref],
    we will aim to shed {\em light} on this topic only with the knowledge of saddle-node bifurcations
    and a simple model proposed by Ermentrout and ...[ref]. 
    
    Consider the problem
    of a firefly flashing under the presence of a periodically flashing light.
    We will model the flashing of the firefly with an angular variable $\theta$
    such that $\theta = 0$ represents the firefly's flash. The firefly has its 
    own inherent frequency $\omega$, i.e. in the absence of stimuli 
    $\dot{\theta} = \omega$. On the other hand, the periodic stimulus will be
    represented by a phase $\phi$ that satisfies $\dot{\phi} = \Omega$, where 
    $\Omega$ is of course the stimuli period. In order to synchronize with the
    stimuli, the firefly will either want to speed up if it is lagging behind
    or slow down if it is going too fast. The simplest non-linear model that
    fulfills these assumptions is the following,
    \begin{align*}
        \dot{\phi} &= \Omega \\
        \dot{\theta} &= \omega + A \sin(\phi -  \theta)
    \end{align*}

    Subtracting both equations and defining $\varphi = \dot{\phi} - \dot{\theta}$
    yields 

    \begin{equation*}
        \dot{\varphi} = \Omega - \omega - A \sin \varphi
    \end{equation*}

    which can be adimensionalized by rescaling $t \to At$ and introducing
    the non dimensional parameter $\mu = (\Omega - \omega)/A$,

    \begin{equation}
        \dot{\varphi} = \mu - \sin \varphi
        \label{eq:pre_bif_sn_exmp}
    \end{equation}

    For $\mu = 0$ where the forcing and intrinsic frequencies are the same, there
    is a stable fixed point at $\varphi = 0$ and an unstable fixed point at $\varphi = \pi$.
    As $\mu$ increases, both equilibria approach each other until they collide for $\mu=\mu_c=1$
    at $\varphi = \pi/2$
    and then disappear for $\mu > 1$. We can clearly recognize that the pair of fixed
    points appear (or disappear) through a saddle-node bifurcation.
    
    Moreover, close to the bifurcation point where $\mu_c = 1$ and $\varphi_c = \pi/2$,
    we can do a Taylor expansion: $\mu = 1 + \eta$ and $\varphi = \pi/2 + u$ 
    where $\eta, u \ll 1$. Using the identity $\sin \varphi = \sin (\pi/2 + u) = \cos u$
    and inserting the previous ansatz into Eq.~(\ref{eq:pre_bif_sn_exmp}) yields
    the following
    \begin{align*}
        \dot{\varphi} = \dot{u} &= 1 + \eta - \cos u \\ 
        &\approx 1 + \eta - (1 - \dfrac12 u^2) \\
        &= \eta - \dfrac12 u^2
    \end{align*}

    Which after adequate rescaling corresponds exactly with the saddle-node
    normal form.
    

\end{exmp}

\subsection{Pitchfork bifurcation}

A {\em pitchfork} bifurcation constitutes the simplest symmetry-breaking bifurcation.
Its normal form is given by

\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{du}{dt} = \varepsilon u - u ^ 3
\end{equation}

Note that the above formula corresponds to a {\em supercritical} bifurcation, the emerging branches from the
bifurcation point are stable. On the contrary, in the {\em subcritical} case, the cubic
term should be positive and a negative quintic term should be added to ensure the solution is bounded.

\section{Localized Structures}
\label{sec:fra_LS}

\subsection{Solitons}

Among localized states, a particularly interesting type are solitons. They were discovered
 for the first time in 1834 by John Scott Russell. He described them 
 as a {\em "large solitary [...] heap of water, which continued its course along the channel without change of form
or diminution of speed"}[cita]. These solitary waves were highly controversial
at the time until Korteweg and de Vries provided an integrable model for shallow water waves
and proved their existence in the model [cita].
It was only a century later that the term soliton was coined by Zabusky and Kruskal
to emphasize their particle-like behavior after observing that solitons could pass through each
other with no change in shape or speed [cita]. Afterwards, the solitons were extensively studied
in other integrable and conservative equations such as the nonlinear Schrödinger
equation. In these systems, they arise due to a balance between dispersion and nonlinearity. 
More recently, the term dissipative soliton was coined to describe a similar localized state
in dissipative systems, where there is a continuous energy influx and dissipation. 
In these systems, they arise due to a balance between dispersion and nonlinearity. 


More recently, the term dissipative soliton was coined to describe a similar state
in dissipative systems, where there is a continuous energy influx and dissipation. 
In this context, an additional balance between gains and losses is required for the formation
of solitons. In what follows and, for the sake of simplicity, we shall use the term soliton
to refer to dissipative solitons as opposed to the original sense discussed previously
that is pertinent to conservative and integrable systems.
