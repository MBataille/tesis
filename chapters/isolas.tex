\chapter{Isolas of localized structures and Ramanâ€“Kerr frequency combs in micro-structured resonators (Chaos, Solitons \& Fractals 174, 113808)}

In section~\ref{sec:fra_LS} we introduced the concept of dissipative localized structures (LSs). Here, we will study the formation
of such structures in nonlinear optical systems where they are often called optical or cavity solitons. 
More specifically, we will analyze the paradigmatic Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) \cite{lugiatolefever1987} used to describe fiber resonators, and
study the formation of LSs when a fourth order derivative and a non-local term are considered.
