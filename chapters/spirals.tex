\label{ch:spirals}

So far, this investigation has focused on drifting one-dimensional localized states in
two non-local optical systems. 
In these two cases, the motion itself was expected since a reflection
symmetry-breaking term was present. Nevertheless, such a term is not always
necessary to set localized states in motion. Indeed, this chapter exposes that motion can arise spontaneously
in an isotropic system of coupled phase oscillators.

In section~\ref{sec:phase_oscillators}, the importance and universality
of phase oscillators have been emphasized, as they offer a comprehensive
description of self-sustained oscillators at the cost of neglecting amplitude dynamics.
Such oscillators are ubiquitous, appearing in flashing fireflies, lasers, neurons,
and even pacemaker cells in the heart. The dynamics of an individual oscillator
represent a profound research challenge, as exemplified by the seminal work of Hodgkin
and Huxley, which earned them the Nobel Prize for their model of neuronal
activity~\cite{hodgkin1952quantitative}. Extending this complexity, the dynamics
of a population of coupled phase oscillators exhibit even greater richness.
A fundamental question in such systems is whether the oscillators will synchronize
and, if so, to what degree.

One of the most outstanding contributions to the field of synchronization was made
by Kuramoto who provided a simple yet powerful model 
for describing coupled oscillators several decades ago~\cite{kuramoto1975model}. 
Remarkably, when Kuramoto and Battogtokh extended the model considering non-local coupling instead
of the original global coupling, they observed an incongruous state
of partial synchrony where coherent (synchronized) and incoherent (desynchronized)
domains coexisted~\cite{kuramoto2002coexistence}.
It could be expected that coupling identical oscillators would only yield a completely coherent
state, yet they showed that the symmetry could be spontaneously broken and the system
would self-organize into two different and coexisting domains, what we now call a chimera state~\cite{abrams2004chimera}.

Even more surprisingly, two-dimensional simulations of the Kuramoto-Battogtokh model 
revealed a planar chimera state in the form of a spiral 
wave~\cite{kuramoto2003rotating,shima2004rotating}. 
This spiral wave chimera, characterized by an incoherent core at the tip of the
spiral where oscillators were desynchronized, stood in contrast to the synchronized
oscillators forming the spiral arms. Unlike previously observed spiral patterns in
reaction-diffusion systems~\cite{hagan1982spiral}, these chimeras exhibited a unique
feature: the phase singularity at the tip was replaced by an incoherent core.
Since their discovery, spiral chimeras have been extensively studied in various systems,
and their existence has been experimentally confirmed, particularly in chemical
systems~\cite{nkomo2013chimera,totz2018spiral}.


In this chapter, we investigate the dynamics of a bound state of two counter-rotating spiral wave chimeras
 in a two-dimensional array of coupled non-identical
phase oscillators. To eliminate the finite-size noise, the
continuum limit of infinitely many oscillators is studied in detail
by numerically simulating the
associated Ott-Antonsen equation. Although a symmetric and isotropic coupling function is considered,
the top-hat function, a spontaneous symmetry breaking arises which causes
the two-core spiral chimeras to develop a permanent motion. Consequently,
the formation of a crescent-shaped filamentary pattern is observed in the incoherent core
of the spirals, and is oriented towards the direction of motion.  Moreover, 3 
different two-core spiral chimeras are identified according to their motion, namely symmetric, asymmetric
and meandering spirals, and their corresponding stability region is determined.

\section{Perspectives}
 

In this work, we have shown that even in a symmetric system, two-core
spiral chimeras move in three different ways. Furthermore, the stability region of symmetric, 
asymmetric and meandering spirals has been identified and presented in a phase diagram.
Nevertheless, a more in-depth numerical analysis is still needed to find not only
stable but also unstable states. This information will be fundamental to indentify
the various bifurcations that lead to the emergence of two-core spiral chimeras
from a homogeneous state, as well as the transition between symmetric and asymmetric
spirals. On the other hand, we have examined the effect of a top-hat coupling function
which has numerical advantages but may not be experimentally relevant. Therefore,
the extent to which these results apply to more realistic couplings remains
to be determined.
